# chess
My implementation of a hot-seat game of chess.

To-do
-------
+ Must add one more rule to make game 'truly' complete -- Threefold repetition: the draw state when repeated board states happen.

Refactor Ideas
---------
+ Replace move logic with decorator overlays.
+ Clean up some of the messy logic.
+ Fix rookie mistakes in general.

Possible Features
---------
+ Online Multiplayer
+ A.I. Players
